## TG-09 Implementation Details

### What Was Built
**TG-09: On-Page Annotations** - A complete visual annotation system that highlights manipulative elements on web pages.

#### Core Features Implemented:
1. **Annotation System** (`src/content/annotator.ts` - 216 lines)
   - Color-coded highlight overlays
   - Severity-based styling (low/medium/high/critical)
   - Tooltips with reasons
   - Position tracking on scroll/resize
   - Smooth fade in/out animations

2. **Message Handlers** (Content Script)
   - `HIGHLIGHT_ELEMENTS`: Shows annotations
   - `CLEAR_HIGHLIGHTS`: Removes annotations
   - Mock data fallback for testing

3. **UI Controls** (Popup)
   - Toggle button (Show/Hide Highlights)
   - State management for annotation visibility
   - Conditional rendering (only shows when issues found)

### Current Implementation Strategy

**Mock Data Approach**: TG-09 is fully functional with mock annotations that target common dark pattern selectors:
- Countdown timers: `.countdown, [class*="countdown"]`
- Scarcity warnings: `button[class*="scarcity"]`
- Popups: `[class*="popup"]`

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ TG-09 can be tested independently
- ‚úÖ No blocking on TG-07 (AI integration)
- ‚úÖ Minimal changes needed when TG-07 merges
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

### Integration with TG-07

**When TG-07 is merged**, only 3 changes needed:

1. **AI Response Type** - Add `elements` array to `AnalysisResult`
2. **Analysis Aggregation** - Include AI-detected elements in analysis result
3. **Popup Handler** - Use `analysisResult.elements` instead of mock data

**Estimated Integration Effort**: 30 minutes  
**Lines of Code to Change**: ~20 lines

See `TG-09-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` for detailed integration steps.

## Development Approach for TG-09

### Problem Solved
TG-09 had a dependency on TG-07 (AI Risk Analysis), which is being developed by another team member. To avoid blocking:

1. **Analyzed the Interface**: Determined expected data structure from AI
2. **Created Mock Data**: Realistic selectors for common dark patterns
3. **Built Complete System**: Full implementation without waiting
4. **Documented Integration**: Clear guide for TG-07 merge

### Benefits of This Approach
- ‚úÖ **No Blocking**: TG-09 complete without waiting for TG-07
- ‚úÖ **Early Testing**: Can test annotation system immediately
- ‚úÖ **Clean Integration**: Minimal diff when merging with TG-07
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Risk**: Integration complexity is low
- ‚úÖ **Team Efficiency**: Both tasks can proceed in parallel

## Testing TG-09

### Manual Testing (Current)
```bash
# 1. Build the extension
npm run build

# 2. Load in Chrome
chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí Load unpacked ‚Üí select 'dist' folder

# 3. Test on any e-commerce site
# - Click "Analyze This Page"
# - Look for "Page Annotations" section
# - Click "Show Highlights" button
# - Verify highlights appear on countdown timers, scarcity warnings, popups
# - Click "Hide Highlights" to clear
```

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Highlights appear with colored borders
- ‚úÖ Tooltips show severity and reason
- ‚úÖ Highlights stay positioned on scroll
- ‚úÖ Smooth fade in/out animations
- ‚úÖ Clean removal on "Hide Highlights"

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Sprint 1 End - Oct 16)
- [ ] Sprint 1 Review & Demo (Thursday 2 PM)
- [ ] Show TG-09 as early Sprint 2 work

### Sprint 2 (Oct 17-23)
- [ ] Complete TG-06 (Heuristic Integration)
- [ ] Complete TG-07 (AI Risk Analysis)
- [ ] **Integrate TG-09 with TG-07** (use integration guide)
- [ ] Complete TG-08 (Policy Summarization)
- [ ] Start TG-10 (Documentation)

### Follow-up PR for TG-09
When TG-07 is merged, create a small PR:
1. Update `AnalysisResult` type
2. Aggregate `elements` in content script
3. Use real data in popup handler
4. Test on 5+ real sites
5. Remove mock data (optional)

## Files Changed (TG-09)

### New Files
- `src/content/annotator.ts` (216 lines) - Complete annotation system
- `TG-09-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` (300+ lines) - Integration documentation

### Modified Files

## Team Communication

### For TG-07 Owner (Senior Engineer 2)
**Subject**: TG-09 Complete - Integration Guide Available

Hi! I've completed TG-09 (On-Page Annotations) with mock data so it doesn't block on TG-07. 

**What I built**:
- Full annotation system with highlights & tooltips
- Mock CSS selectors for testing
- UI toggle button in popup

**What you need to provide from TG-07**:
- `elements` array in AI response with this structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    selector: string,  // CSS selector (e.g., ".countdown-timer")
    reason: string,    // Why flagged
    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  }
  ```

**Integration effort**: ~30 min, see `TG-09-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

Let me know if you have questions!
